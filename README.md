# Tabletime

The simple time-tabling app, built to keep you on track.

## Background

This app was developed as part of my A-level Computer Science coursework. The primary reason I decided to create a timetabling application was that current alternatives had a lengthy and tedious setup process. Compared to other timetabling apps, you only need to input your daily periods once and then drag corresponding lessons onto them - this is a much more efficient solution and increases user satisfaction. I wanted to bring this feature alongside cloud sync in a streamlined app multi-platform app built with Flutter and Firebase for the backend.

## Features

- [x] Multi-week timetable
- [x] Weekend days
- [ ] Multiple timetables
- [x] Cloud sync
- [x] Easy setup, with draggable lessons
- [x] Notifications with timing options
